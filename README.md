OrderBot is an interactive WhatsApp automation tool built using Python, designed to streamline family or small-group product ordering directly within a WhatsApp group.
It empowers users with intuitive commands like #add, #delete, #list, #undo, and #clear to manage real-time shopping lists, making coordination seamless and centralized. 
Initially leveraging pywhatkit for rapid MVP delivery, it transitions to Selenium for robust browser control, persistent sessions, and real-time message reading/writing. 
The bot ensures minimal manual intervention, keeping the entire flow conversational and interactive inside WhatsApp itself. Designed modularly with separate command, storage, and control layers, itâ€™s built for scalability and future integrations 
Think inventory syncing, automated order placement, or even AI-driven purchase suggestions. 
This project embodies agile innovation, bringing smart automation directly to personal spaces without the overhead of external apps.
